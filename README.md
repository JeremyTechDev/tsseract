## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

First, you will need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project and set some environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=8080
DB_NAME=...
DB_ADDRESS=...
JWT_KEY=...
```

### Minimal Set-up

You can just run the app using the Docker 🐳. To do that, you will need to download and install the following Docker technologies:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) - **Optional** To explore and manipulate the database

After that, you only need to run the following at the root of the project in a console:

```
docker-compose up
```

### Full Set-up

You will need to have installed and running these technologies in order to run the application:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Dependencies Management
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es) - Database Storage
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) - **Optional** To explore and manipulate the database

📌 **To run the app with npm. You need to make sure that the env variable `DB_ADDRESS` is empty or set to `localhost`.**

- Clone the repo:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jeremy2918/tsseract-app.git
  ```

- Install dependencies:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

- To run the client side of the app:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

- To run the server of the app:

  ```
  npm run server
  ```

- Or you can start both in development:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

You should get some of the following logs on the console:

```
🚀 Running server on port 8080...
📡 Connected to MongoDB...
```

## Running the tests

The app uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing framework for this App 🧑‍💻. To run tests, just run `npm test` in the console at the project directory.

Tests are run before every push and as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/jeremy2918/tsseract-app/actions).
