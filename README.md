Tsseract in a social media that allows you to create content and earn money with it depending on the amount of view and interactions your posts have.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es)

### Installing

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jermy2918/tsseract-app.git
  ```

- Install dependencies:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

  ```
  NODE_ENV=5000
